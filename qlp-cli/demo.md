# QuantumLayer CLI Demo 🚀

## What We Built

A complete CLI tool that connects to your existing QuantumLayer backend and provides:

### 1. **Simple Generation Command**
```bash
$ qlp generate "REST API for task management with authentication"

🚀 Generation Request
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Project: REST API for task management with authentication
Language: auto
Output: ./generated
Deploy: none
GitHub: no

Proceed with generation? [Y/n]: y

⠏ Generating... 47%

✅ Generation Complete!

Generation Summary
─────────────────
Files Generated    47
Total Lines        2,341
Test Coverage      94%
Output Path        ./generated/capsule_123

Generated Files:
  📄 main.py
  📄 models.py
  📄 auth.py
  📄 database.py
  📄 tests/test_api.py
  ... and 42 more files

💡 Use 'qlp interactive' for a conversational experience
```

### 2. **Interactive Mode**
```bash
$ qlp interactive

🧠 QuantumLayer Interactive Mode

Welcome! I'll help you build a complete software system through conversation.

You: I want to build a blog platform
QL: What programming language would you prefer? (Python, JavaScript, Go, etc.)
You: Python with FastAPI
QL: Should I include database and authentication?
You: Yes, PostgreSQL and JWT
QL: Great! Should I include an admin panel and API documentation?
You: Yes please
QL: That sounds like a solid project! Type 'generate' when ready!
You: generate

### 3. **GitHub Integration**
```bash
$ qlp generate "Discord bot with moderation" --github

🚀 Generating and pushing to GitHub...
✅ Repository created: https://github.com/user/qlp-discord-bot
✅ Code pushed successfully!
```

### 4. **From Image (Future)**
```bash
$ qlp from-image architecture-diagram.png

🎨 Analyzing image: architecture-diagram.png
Image size: 1920x1080, Format: PNG

Detected Architecture:
A microservices architecture with API Gateway, Auth Service, 
User Service, and PostgreSQL database

Generate this system? [Y/n]: y
```

## How It Works

1. **API Client** (`api_client.py`)
   - Connects to your existing endpoints
   - Handles workflow creation and monitoring
   - Downloads generated capsules

2. **Interactive Session** (`interactive.py`)
   - Natural language understanding
   - Context building through conversation
   - Smart prompting for missing information

3. **Rich UI** 
   - Beautiful terminal output with colors
   - Progress bars and spinners
   - Formatted tables and panels

4. **Configuration** (`config.py`)
   - Stores API endpoint and credentials
   - User preferences
   - Persistent settings

## Integration Points

The CLI connects to these existing endpoints:
- `POST /execute` - Start generation
- `GET /status/{workflow_id}` - Check progress
- `GET /api/capsules/{id}/download` - Get results
- `POST /generate/complete-with-github` - GitHub integration

## Next Steps

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd qlp-cli
   pip install -e .
   ```

2. **Configure Backend**
   ```bash
   export QLP_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
   ```

3. **Start Using**
   ```bash
   qlp generate "your first project"
   ```

## Value Proposition

- **Instant Gratification** - Developers can start using immediately
- **No Infrastructure** - Works with local Docker backend
- **Beautiful UX** - Rich terminal UI that developers love
- **Viral Potential** - "Look what I built with one command!"

## Distribution Plan

1. **Week 1**: Package and test with early users
2. **Week 2**: 
   - Upload to PyPI
   - Launch on Product Hunt
   - Post demo video on Twitter
3. **Month 1**: 
   - 1,000+ downloads
   - Community feedback
   - Feature requests

The CLI is your **fastest path to users** while the full platform matures!
