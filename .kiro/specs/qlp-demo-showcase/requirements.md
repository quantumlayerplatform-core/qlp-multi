2. WHEN patterns are selected THEN the system SHALL provide human-readable reasoning for the selection
3. WHEN multiple patterns are recommended THEN they SHALL be ranked by expected value and computational cost
4. WHEN the unified optimization engine is used THEN it SHALL combine pattern selection with meta-prompt evolution
5. WHEN the optimization results are displayed THEN they SHALL show performance predictions and cost analysis

### Requirement 4: Multi-Tier Agent System Demo

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want to see how different agent tiers handle tasks of varying complexity, so that I can understand the platform's intelligent routing capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN simple tasks are submitted THEN they SHALL be routed to T0/T1 agents for cost efficiency
2. WHEN complex tasks are submitted THEN they SHALL be routed to T2/T3 agents for quality
3. WHEN ensemble mode is enabled THEN multiple agents SHALL collaborate with consensus mechanisms
4. WHEN agent performance is tracked THEN metrics SHALL show success rates and execution times
5. WHEN agent selection is explained THEN the reasoning SHALL be transparent and logical

### Requirement 5: Enterprise-Grade Project Generation

**User Story:** As an enterprise developer, I want to see complete project generation with production-ready features, so that I can evaluate the platform for real-world use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an enterprise project request is submitted THEN it SHALL generate a complete project structure
2. WHEN the project is generated THEN it SHALL include tests, documentation, CI/CD configs, and Docker files
3. WHEN the project structure is analyzed THEN it SHALL follow industry best practices and conventions
4. WHEN the generated code is validated THEN it SHALL pass all 5 validation stages
5. WHEN the project is exported THEN it SHALL be available in multiple formats (ZIP, TAR, GitHub)

### Requirement 6: Real-Time Validation Pipeline Demo

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want to see the 5-stage validation pipeline in action, so that I can understand how code quality is ensured.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is generated THEN it SHALL automatically go through syntax validation
2. WHEN syntax validation passes THEN style validation SHALL check formatting and conventions
3. WHEN style validation passes THEN security validation SHALL scan for vulnerabilities
4. WHEN security validation passes THEN type validation SHALL verify type safety
5. WHEN all static checks pass THEN runtime validation SHALL execute the code in a sandbox
6. WHEN validation is complete THEN a comprehensive report SHALL be generated with confidence scores

### Requirement 7: GitHub Integration Demo

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see automatic GitHub repository creation and code push, so that I can understand the platform's integration capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a capsule is generated THEN it SHALL be pushable to a new GitHub repository
2. WHEN GitHub integration is triggered THEN it SHALL create a properly structured repository
3. WHEN the repository is created THEN it SHALL include README, proper file organization, and metadata
4. WHEN enterprise mode is enabled THEN it SHALL include additional enterprise features
5. WHEN the push is complete THEN the repository SHALL be immediately usable for development

### Requirement 8: Vector Memory and Learning Demo

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to see how the system learns from past executions, so that I can understand the continuous improvement capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN similar requests are submitted THEN the system SHALL find and use past patterns
2. WHEN code patterns are stored THEN they SHALL be searchable by semantic similarity
3. WHEN agent performance is tracked THEN metrics SHALL influence future agent selection
4. WHEN learning occurs THEN the system SHALL show improved performance over time
5. WHEN memory is queried THEN it SHALL provide insights into usage patterns and optimization opportunities

### Requirement 9: Interactive Demo Interface

**User Story:** As a demo presenter, I want an interactive interface to showcase different platform capabilities, so that I can provide an engaging demonstration experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the demo interface is launched THEN it SHALL provide a menu of demonstration scenarios
2. WHEN a scenario is selected THEN it SHALL execute with real-time progress updates
3. WHEN execution is in progress THEN it SHALL show which services are being used
4. WHEN results are generated THEN they SHALL be displayed with syntax highlighting and formatting
5. WHEN the demo is complete THEN it SHALL provide summary statistics and performance metrics

### Requirement 10: Performance and Scalability Demo
