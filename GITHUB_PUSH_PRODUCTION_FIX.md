# GitHub Push Integration - Production Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The GitHub push functionality was not working because:
1. `push_to_github_activity` was defined in `main.py` but not in `worker_production.py`
2. The production workflow didn't check for GitHub push metadata
3. Field name mismatches between endpoints and workflow (github_repo_name vs repo_name)

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added push_to_github_activity to worker_production.py
- Defined the activity with proper error handling
- Added support for loading capsule from storage
- Integrated with enhanced GitHub integration

### 2. Added GitHub push logic to QLPWorkflow
- Checks for push_to_github in request metadata
- Handles different field names (github_repo_name and repo_name)
- Logs GitHub parameters for debugging
- Proper error handling and reporting

### 3. Fixed field name handling
- Workflow now checks both github_repo_name and repo_name
- Similarly for github_private/private and github_enterprise/use_enterprise

## Current Status
Despite the fixes, the activity is still showing as "not registered" in the worker. This appears to be a Temporal registration issue where the activity exists in the module but isn't being properly registered with the worker.

## Known Issues
1. The push_to_github_activity is not being registered by Temporal worker
2. Available activities list doesn't include push_to_github_activity
3. This might be due to:
   - Import order issues
   - Temporal SDK registration requirements
   - Docker caching issues

## Next Steps to Fix

### Option 1: Import the activity from main.py
Instead of redefining the activity, import it from main.py where it's already defined:
```python
from src.orchestrator.main import push_to_github_activity
```

### Option 2: Check activity registration
Ensure the activity is being registered correctly with the worker:
```python
# Debug registration
for activity in activities:
    print(f"Registering activity: {activity.__name__}")
```

### Option 3: Use a different registration approach
Register activities individually rather than as a list:
```python
worker = Worker(
    client,
    task_queue=settings.TEMPORAL_TASK_QUEUE,
    workflows=workflows,
    activities={
        decompose_request_activity,
        select_agent_tier_activity,
        # ... other activities
        push_to_github_activity
    }
)
```

## Test Commands
```bash
# Test with explicit token
GITHUB_TOKEN=$(grep "^GITHUB_TOKEN=" .env | cut -d'=' -f2)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/generate/complete-with-github \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "description": "Create a Python calculator",
    "github_token": "'$GITHUB_TOKEN'",
    "repo_name": "test-repo"
  }'

# Check workflow status
curl http://localhost:8000/workflow/status/{workflow_id}

# Monitor logs
docker logs qlp-temporal-worker -f | grep -i github
```

## Verification Steps
1. Check if activity is in the module: ✅
2. Check if activity is decorated: ✅
3. Check if activity is in activities list: ✅
4. Check if worker registers the activity: ❌

The core issue appears to be that while the activity is defined and included in the activities list, Temporal's worker isn't registering it properly. This might require importing the activity from main.py or investigating Temporal's activity registration mechanism more deeply.
