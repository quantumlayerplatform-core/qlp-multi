# Meta Prompt System Improvements

## Current State Analysis

The meta prompt system is sophisticated but has several areas for improvement:

### 1. **Evolution Strategy Gaps**

Current strategies are good but missing:
- **EMERGENT_COMPLEXITY**: Build complex solutions from simple rules
- **FIRST_PRINCIPLES**: Decompose to fundamental truths and rebuild
- **ADVERSARIAL**: Think like an attacker/competitor
- **BIOMIMICRY**: Apply patterns from nature/biology
- **QUANTUM_THINKING**: Consider superposition of solutions

### 2. **Learning Feedback Loop Issues**

```python
# Current: Simple success/failure tracking
success = performance_metrics.get("validation_score", 0) > 0.7

# Improved: Multi-dimensional feedback
feedback_dimensions = {
    "correctness": validation_score,
    "elegance": code_complexity_score,
    "performance": execution_time_score,
    "security": security_audit_score,
    "maintainability": cognitive_load_score,
    "innovation": novelty_score
}
```

### 3. **Genome Evolution Limitations**

- **No Cross-Role Learning**: Architects don't learn from implementers
- **Limited Mutation Types**: Only 4 mutation types
- **No Epigenetics**: Environmental factors don't affect expression
- **Static Fitness Function**: Doesn't adapt to changing requirements

### 4. **Principle Library Improvements**

Missing modern principles:
- **Reversibility**: Every operation should be undoable
- **Observability**: If you can't see it, you can't fix it
- **Antifragility**: Systems that improve under stress
- **Evolutionary Architecture**: Fitness functions for architecture
- **Team Topologies**: Conway's Law applied intentionally

### 5. **Meta-Cognitive Enhancements**

Current recursive improvement is good but could add:
- **Metacognitive Monitoring**: Track thinking process quality
- **Dialectical Synthesis**: Thesis → Antithesis → Synthesis
- **Analogical Reasoning**: Transfer solutions across domains
- **Counterfactual Thinking**: "What if we did the opposite?"

## Proposed Improvements

### 1. **Enhanced Evolution Strategies**

```python
class PromptEvolutionStrategy(Enum):
    # Existing strategies...
    
    # New strategies
    FIRST_PRINCIPLES = "first_principles"  # Elon Musk approach
    EMERGENT_COMPLEXITY = "emergent_complexity"  # Simple rules, complex behavior
    ADVERSARIAL = "adversarial"  # Red team thinking
    BIOMIMICRY = "biomimicry"  # Nature-inspired solutions
    QUANTUM_THINKING = "quantum_thinking"  # Superposition of approaches
    DIALECTICAL = "dialectical"  # Thesis-antithesis-synthesis
    ANALOGICAL = "analogical"  # Cross-domain transfer
    ANTIFRAGILE = "antifragile"  # Nassim Taleb approach
```

### 2. **Multi-Agent Genome Sharing**

```python
class GenomeExchange:
    """Enable cross-pollination between different agent types"""
    
    def share_successful_patterns(self, 
                                 from_role: str, 
                                 to_role: str,
                                 pattern_type: str):
        """Transfer successful patterns between roles"""
        # Architects share design patterns with implementers
        # Security experts share vulnerability patterns with all
        # Optimizers share performance patterns
```

### 3. **Adaptive Fitness Functions**

```python
def calculate_adaptive_fitness(genome: PromptGenome, 
                             context: Dict[str, Any]) -> float:
    """Fitness function that adapts based on context"""
    
    # Base fitness
    base_fitness = genome.fitness_score()
    
    # Context modifiers
    if context.get("is_startup"):
        # Prioritize speed and flexibility
        base_fitness *= genome.agility_score()
    elif context.get("is_enterprise"):
        # Prioritize reliability and compliance
        base_fitness *= genome.reliability_score()
    
    # Temporal decay - recent performance matters more
    time_weight = calculate_temporal_weight(genome.evolution_history)
    
    return base_fitness * time_weight
```

### 4. **Prompt DNA Sequences**

```python
class PromptDNA:
    """Fine-grained building blocks for prompts"""
    
    sequences = {
        "CRITICAL_THINKING": "Question assumptions → Identify biases → Seek refutation",
        "SYSTEMS_THINKING": "Identify components → Map interactions → Find leverage points",
        "CREATIVE_SYNTHESIS": "Combine disparate ideas → Find unexpected connections",
        "DEFENSIVE_CODING": "Assume malicious input → Handle edge cases → Fail safely"
    }
    
    def combine_sequences(self, sequences: List[str]) -> str:
        """Combine DNA sequences into coherent instructions"""
        # Smart combination logic
```

### 5. **Metacognitive Monitoring**

```python
class MetacognitiveMonitor:
    """Monitor and improve the thinking process itself"""
    
    def analyze_reasoning_chain(self, thoughts: List[str]) -> Dict[str, float]:
        return {
            "logical_consistency": self._check_consistency(thoughts),
            "assumption_validity": self._validate_assumptions(thoughts),
            "creativity_score": self._measure_creativity(thoughts),
            "depth_score": self._measure_depth(thoughts),
            "breadth_score": self._measure_breadth(thoughts)
        }
```

### 6. **Principle Evolution**

```python
class EvolvingPrinciples:
    """Principles that adapt based on outcomes"""
    
    def mutate_principle(self, principle: str, outcome: Dict) -> str:
        """Evolve a principle based on its effectiveness"""
        
        if outcome["caused_bug"]:
            # Add defensive clause
            return f"{principle} - but verify edge cases"
        elif outcome["improved_performance"]:
            # Strengthen principle
            return f"ALWAYS {principle}"
        elif outcome["increased_complexity"]:
            # Add balance
            return f"{principle} - while maintaining simplicity"
```

### 7. **Contextual Prompt Injection**

```python
def inject_context_awareness(prompt: str, context: Dict) -> str:
    """Dynamically inject context-specific guidance"""
    
    injections = []
    
    if context.get("tech_debt_high"):
        injections.append("Prioritize refactoring over new features")
    
    if context.get("deadline_tight"):
        injections.append("Focus on MVP - perfection can wait")
    
    if context.get("team_junior"):
        injections.append("Write extra clear code with teaching comments")
    
    return prompt + "\n\nContext-Specific Guidance:\n" + "\n".join(injections)
```

### 8. **Prompt Performance Analytics**

```python
class PromptAnalytics:
    """Deep analytics on prompt effectiveness"""
    
    def analyze_prompt_performance(self, prompt_id: str) -> Dict:
        return {
            "success_rate_by_complexity": self._analyze_by_complexity(),
            "failure_patterns": self._identify_failure_patterns(),
            "time_to_solution": self._measure_efficiency(),
            "code_quality_metrics": self._assess_output_quality(),
            "innovation_score": self._measure_novelty(),
            "reusability_score": self._assess_pattern_reuse()
        }
```
