# AWS Bedrock Integration - Test Summary

## ✅ What We've Accomplished

### 1. **AWS Bedrock Integration Complete**
- ✅ Added AWS Bedrock as 5th LLM provider in `azure_llm_client.py`
- ✅ Created production-grade `aws_bedrock_client.py` with enterprise features
- ✅ Updated `config.py` with comprehensive AWS settings
- ✅ Added Claude 3.7 Sonnet to model registry

### 2. **Configuration Complete**
- ✅ AWS credentials configured in `.env`
- ✅ Region set to `eu-west-2` (London)
- ✅ All tiers (T0-T3) configured to use `aws_bedrock`
- ✅ Models configured:
  - T0: Claude 3 Haiku
  - T1: Claude 3 Sonnet
  - T2: Claude 3.7 Sonnet (newest!)
  - T3: Claude 3.7 Sonnet

### 3. **Testing Status**
- ✅ AWS Bedrock client tested directly - **Working!**
- ✅ Configuration verified in containers
- ⏳ Platform integration - Requires Docker image rebuild

## 🔄 Current Status

The AWS Bedrock integration is complete but the Docker containers need to be rebuilt to include the new code. The platform is currently still using Azure OpenAI because the containers have the old code.

## 📋 Quick Tests You Can Run

### 1. Test AWS Bedrock Directly (Outside Docker)
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python test_bedrock_simple.py
```
✅ This works and shows AWS Bedrock is functional

### 2. Test Platform Features
```bash
# Test /execute endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/execute \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "description": "Create a Python hello world function",
    "language": "python"
  }'

# Test GitHub integration
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/generate/complete-with-github \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "description": "Create a Python TODO app",
    "language": "python",
    "github_repo": "test-todo-app"
  }'
```

### 3. Test CLI
```bash
qlp generate "create a fibonacci function" --language python
qlp status <workflow-id>
qlp list --limit 5
```

## 🚀 To Enable AWS Bedrock in Platform

### Option 1: Rebuild All Services (Recommended)
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.platform.yml down
docker-compose -f docker-compose.platform.yml build
docker-compose -f docker-compose.platform.yml up -d
```
This will take ~10-15 minutes but ensures all services use AWS Bedrock.

### Option 2: Quick Test (Development)
Mount the source code as a volume in docker-compose.yml to use local changes without rebuilding.

## 📊 Cost Comparison

| Provider | Model | Input Cost | Output Cost | Speed |
|----------|-------|------------|-------------|-------|
| Azure OpenAI | GPT-4 | $0.03/1K | $0.06/1K | Fast |
| AWS Bedrock | Claude 3 Haiku | $0.00025/1K | $0.00125/1K | Very Fast |
| AWS Bedrock | Claude 3.7 Sonnet | $0.003/1K | $0.015/1K | Fast |

AWS Bedrock with Claude models offers:
- 🚀 Better code generation quality
- 💰 Competitive pricing
- 🌍 Regional availability (eu-west-2)
- 🔒 Enterprise security features

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Rebuild Docker images** to activate AWS Bedrock in the platform
2. **Monitor usage** in AWS Console
3. **Set up cost alerts** in AWS Budgets
4. **Test different models** for various use cases

## 🔍 Verification

Once Docker images are rebuilt, verify AWS Bedrock is active:

```bash
# Check logs for AWS Bedrock usage
docker logs qlp-agent-factory -f | grep -i bedrock

# Verify environment
docker exec qlp-agent-factory env | grep AWS_REGION
```

You should see:
- `AWS_REGION=eu-west-2`
- Log entries mentioning "aws_bedrock" as provider
- Claude model IDs in responses
