# Azure Container Registry Build Status

## âœ… Successfully Completed

### 1. **Azure Container Registry Created**
- **Registry Name**: qlpregistry
- **Login Server**: qlpregistry.azurecr.io
- **Location**: UK South
- **Resource Group**: qlp-rg

### 2. **All Services Built and Pushed**
Successfully pushed all 6 services to ACR (AMD64 architecture):

| Service | Image URL | Status |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Orchestrator | `qlpregistry.azurecr.io/qlp/orchestrator:latest` | âœ… Pushed |
| Agent Factory | `qlpregistry.azurecr.io/qlp/agent-factory:latest` | âœ… Pushed |
| Validation Mesh | `qlpregistry.azurecr.io/qlp/validation-mesh:latest` | âœ… Pushed |
| Vector Memory | `qlpregistry.azurecr.io/qlp/vector-memory:latest` | âœ… Pushed |
| Execution Sandbox | `qlpregistry.azurecr.io/qlp/execution-sandbox:latest` | âœ… Pushed |
| Temporal Worker | `qlpregistry.azurecr.io/qlp/temporal-worker:latest` | âœ… Pushed |

## ðŸš€ Optimizations Applied

1. **Improved .dockerignore**: Excluded large files, reducing context from 550MB to ~10MB
2. **Single Architecture Build**: Built AMD64 only for speed (multi-arch can be added later)
3. **Layer Caching**: Used Docker layer caching for faster rebuilds
4. **Build Time**: Reduced from timeout (>5 mins) to ~1-2 mins per service

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps

### 1. Deploy AKS Cluster
```bash
cd deployments/terraform/azure
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

### 2. Update Kubernetes Manifests
All Kubernetes manifests need to be updated with the new ACR image URLs:
```yaml
image: qlpregistry.azurecr.io/qlp/orchestrator:latest
```

### 3. Configure AKS to Pull from ACR
```bash
# Attach ACR to AKS
az aks update -n qlp-aks -g qlp-rg --attach-acr qlpregistry
```

## ðŸ”§ Scripts Created

1. **Quick Build Script**: `/deployments/azure/quick-build-push.sh`
   - Builds and pushes all services sequentially
   - AMD64 only for speed
   - Includes cache optimization

2. **Multi-arch Build Script**: `/deployments/azure/build-multiarch.sh`
   - For future multi-architecture builds
   - Supports AMD64 and ARM64
   - More comprehensive but slower

## ðŸ“Œ Important Notes

- All images are currently AMD64 only
- Images are tagged as `:latest`
- ACR is in Standard tier (supports geo-replication if needed)
- No authentication issues with ACR (using Azure CLI auth)

## ðŸŽ¯ Ready for AKS Deployment!

The container images are now ready in Azure Container Registry. The next step is to deploy the AKS cluster and configure it to pull these images.
