# GitHub Push Integration Fix - Production Implementation

## Problem Identified
The GitHub push functionality was not working because:
1. The `push_to_github_activity` was defined in `main.py` but not registered in `worker_production.py`
2. The production workflow (`QLPWorkflow`) didn't have logic to check for and execute GitHub push
3. The activity wasn't included in the worker's activities list

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added `push_to_github_activity` to worker_production.py
```python
@activity.defn
async def push_to_github_activity(params: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Push capsule to GitHub with enterprise structure - Production implementation"""
    # Production-grade implementation with:
    # - Error handling and logging
    # - Support for both capsule object and capsule_id
    # - Environment variable fallback for GitHub token
    # - Enterprise structure support
    # - Metadata updates after successful push
```

### 2. Registered activity in worker
```python
activities = [
    decompose_request_activity,
    select_agent_tier_activity,
    execute_task_activity,
    validate_result_activity,
    execute_in_sandbox_activity,
    request_aitl_review_activity,
    create_ql_capsule_activity,
    llm_clean_code_activity,
    prepare_delivery_activity,
    push_to_github_activity  # Added this
]
```

### 3. Added GitHub push logic to workflow
The workflow now checks for `push_to_github` in request metadata after capsule creation:
```python
# Check if GitHub push is requested
push_to_github = request.get("metadata", {}).get("push_to_github", False)
if push_to_github and workflow_result.get("capsule_id"):
    # Execute GitHub push activity with proper parameters
    github_result = await workflow.execute_activity(
        push_to_github_activity,
        github_params,
        start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(minutes=5),
        heartbeat_timeout=timedelta(minutes=2),
        retry_policy=RetryPolicy(...)
    )
```

## Key Features of the Fix

1. **Production-Grade Error Handling**
   - Try-catch blocks with detailed error logging
   - Graceful failure without breaking the workflow
   - Error details added to workflow result

2. **Flexible Token Management**
   - Supports token from request metadata
   - Falls back to GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable
   - Clear error messages when token is missing

3. **Enterprise Support**
   - Uses EnhancedGitHubIntegration for enterprise structure
   - Configurable via `use_enterprise` parameter
   - Intelligent file organization and CI/CD setup

4. **Metadata Tracking**
   - Updates capsule metadata with GitHub URL
   - Records push timestamp
   - Returns comprehensive result with repository details

## How to Use

### Via API endpoints:
```bash
# With GitHub push
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/generate/complete-with-github \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "description": "Create a Python REST API",
    "metadata": {
      "push_to_github": true,
      "github_token": "ghp_yourtoken",
      "repo_name": "my-api-project",
      "private": false
    }
  }'
```

### Via Enterprise endpoints:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/enterprise/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "description": "Create a Python REST API",
    "auto_push_github": true,
    "github_token": "ghp_yourtoken",
    "repo_name": "my-enterprise-api"
  }'
```

## Required Rebuild
After these changes, Docker containers need to be rebuilt:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.platform.yml build
docker-compose -f docker-compose.platform.yml up -d
```

## Verification
To verify the fix is working:
1. Check worker logs: `docker logs qlp-temporal-worker -f | grep push_to_github`
2. Submit a request with GitHub push enabled
3. Monitor workflow execution in Temporal UI
4. Verify repository creation on GitHub

## Next Steps
1. Monitor production usage for any edge cases
2. Consider adding GitHub organization support
3. Implement PR creation workflow
4. Add branch management features
